# Multi-User-VR
Unity-project for my bachelor-thesis
(build in Unity v 2019.3.13f1)

The goal of this project/study is investigating the impact of different VR-locomotion-
techniques and avatars in multi-user VR settings, specifically on copresence
(presence), cybersickness, fairness and fun. While the impact of locomotion
techniques (on cybersickness) is reletivly well researched, there is not much research
in multi-user contexts. The two different locomotion techniques (Teleport and Joystick)
and two different avatars (neutral/basic and humanoid) will be tested.
